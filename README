Run following commands to compile and boot photon:
make in src folder
./setup_floppy.sh
./system_boot.sh


2nd Version of Bootloader:
An independent assembly code(first_process.s) is compiled. This code is being executed by placing it in 2nd half(256) of MBR(512).
second_process.s file is initial version of second process. Currently this can be executed just like bootloader.
commands:
cd src
make
dd if=first_process.o of=boot_loader.o ibs=1 obs=1 seek=256 count=70 conv=notrunc
cd ..
./setup_floppy.sh
./system_boot.sh


Note:
creating new floppy image:
$ dd bs=512 count=2880 if=/dev/zero of=imagefile.img
$ mkfs.msdos imagefile.img
